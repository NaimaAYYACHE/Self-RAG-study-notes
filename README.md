# **🤖 SELF-RAG Study Repository**

## **✨ What is SELF-RAG?**

**SELF-RAG** = *Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Generation*

A next-level LLM framework that:

* 🔍 **Retrieves** info on-demand from external sources
* 🧠 **Thinks & Reasons** like a language model
* 💭 **Self-Reflects** using special tokens to check support, relevance, and usefulness
* ✍️ **Generates** high-quality, factual, and controllable outputs

**In short:**

> *It retrieves when necessary, reflects while writing, and critiques itself to improve accuracy.*
